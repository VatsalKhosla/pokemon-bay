# pokemon-bay
It's an auction website for pokemons where we can buy and sell items the person with the highest bid wins and the item belongs to him.
I used Django as a framework for my backend, HTML and CSS for frontend. The database was stored using SQLite on Django models.
This project helped me explore the side of python language where it can be used for building web application.
